Multi-Paxos Example
===================
Tom Cocagne <tom.cocagne@gmail.com>


Purpose
-------

Paxos and multi-paxos have been around for decades but there are few reference
implementations for those learning the subjects to experiment with. This
repository contains a demonstration application specifically intended to fill
that role. The application maintains a single replicated value across a cluster
of nodes and the code is implemented with an eye towards strong separations of
concerns so that implementations for various aspects of the codebase may be
easily swapped out.

This example uses very simple but functional strategies for each of the
implementation-defined aspects of multi-paxos. The strategies are far too
simplistic for effective real-world use but they do work and the result is a
small and relatively simple code base. This will hopefully show that multi-paxos
isn't 'inherently' all that complex or difficult to implement. When enhanced
for operation in practical environments, a significant level of complexity may
need to be added but as this example also demonstrates, software designs
emphasizing a strong separation-of-concerns can effectively compartmentalize the
areas of complexity and isolate them from one another.

This repository was created as a companion to the
https://understandingpaxos.wordpress.com[Understanding Paxos] paper.

Implementation Approach
-----------------------

The code is written in Python using an asynchronous programming model. The
http://www.twistedmatrix.com/[Twisted] framework is used to provide UDP
networking, the asynchronous callback mechanism, function scheduling, and the
overall reactor loop. To make the code easier to read by those not overly
familiar with Python and/or Twisted, the use of most advanced features in both
has been eschewed in favor of more straight-forward implementations. For the few
that are used, a <<python_ref,section>> towards the end of this readme is
dedicated to providing a brief overview of how they work.

Separation-of-concerns is one of the main goals of the code and
<<mixin_classes,Mixin Classes>> are the primary means by which this is
accomplished. Mixin classes are well suited for cleanly encapsulating the
resolution, synchronization, and master-lease implementations. In addition to
enhancing clarity, mixin classes provide a convenient means for swapping in
alternative implementations and allowing conditional inclusion of optional
functionality. The master lease implementation, for example, is purely an
optimization and is not required for correct operation. The server
implementation allows this feature to be used or excluded via a command-line
flag. 

The configuration of the multi-paxos chain is defined in 'config.py' and
defaults to 3 servers with UIDs of 'A', 'B', and 'C'. A minimum of two must be
used for consensus to be reached. Each server uses a state file to support
recovery and it defaults to +/tmp/<UID>.json+ (Windows users will need to adjust
the file name). If a server is offline while the chain is modified, the catchup
process will bring it up to date within a relatively short period of time.

.Running the server
[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Without Master Leases:
$ python server.py <A|B|C>
$
# With Master Leases
$ python server.py --master <A|B|C>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The client application requires a server id and a new value to propose.
The provided server will be requested to set the value to the second argument
via a fire-and-forget UDP packet. No error checking is done so if the server
is offline or there is a networking error, it will not be reported. Also,
when master leases are being used, the client will not warn in the event that the
request is sent to a non-master peer. Instead, the receiving server will print an
error message that states which peer is currently the master. It is assumed
that all of the servers and the client will be run on the same screen but in
different terminals.

.Running the client
[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ python client.py <A|B|C> <new_value>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Understanding the Source
------------------------

To quickly get up to speed on the implementation, the recommended order
to follow is:

. If unfamiliar with <<mixin_classes,Mixin Classes>> or <<python_ref, Python & Twisted>>
  read through those sections first.
. Read through the overviews provided here on each module to get a sense for
  how the pieces are intended to fit together.
. Look through 'composable_paxos.py' to see how the core Paxos algorithm is
  implemented.
. Look through 'replicated_value.py' to see how instances are chained together
  to maintain a single, replicated value.
. Look through 'resolution_strategy.py' to see how the mixin class adds
  retransmissions and exponential backoffs to the passive baseclass.
. Look through 'sync_strategy.py' to see how falling behind is detected
  and how catching up is achieved.
. Look through 'server.py' to see how the mixin classes are woven together
. Finally, look through 'master_strategy.py' to see how master leases and
  single-round-trip resolution can be added to the basic implementation.


messenger.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Messenger class encapsulates the message-passing strategy for the
application. +BaseReplicatedValue+ instances send messages by calling one of the
Messenger's +send_<message-type>+ methods and receive messages by specifying a
+receive_<message-type>+ method for each message type it supports. The messenger
class will dynamically look up the method for handling incoming packets by
searching the class hierarchy for an appropriately named method based off of the
incoming message's message type.

To keep things simple for this example, messages are sent over UDP and use a
simple JSON encoding format.



composable_paxos.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module, which is also available as stand alone and pip-installable package,
defines the core Paxos algorithm as a set of composable classes. The classes are
completely agnostic of the messaging approach used by the enclosing
application. Message reception is modeled as method calls where the arguments
are the message content and message transmission is modeled by returned objects
that contain the message content.



replicated_value.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines the +BaseReplicatedValue+ class and preforms three
functions:

* Maintains the multi-paxos chain by tracking the current instance and creating
  a new +PaxosInstance+ object each time resolution is achieved.
* Serves as a bridge between the +Messenger+ class that provides access to the 
  network and the current +PaxosInstance+ object
* Saves and restores state from a file prior to sending each Promise and 
  Accept message as well as each time resolution is achieved.

Of particular note is that this class is completely passive. When a message is
received from a client, this class simply converts the message into a call to
the underlying +composable_paxos.PaxosInstance+ instance and potentially sends a
reply message. It does not, however, initiate the sending of any original
messages or try to drive the resolution process forward. Those details as well
as those of catch up and master-lease strategies are left to mixin classes.



resolution_strategy.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines a mixin class that implements all of the logic needed to
ensure that a Paxos instance will eventually achieve resolution. It does
so by immediately attempting to drive the process forward if it is the first
to propose a value and it steps in to continue driving the process forward if
another peer falls silent before completing the process. Continual inter-peer
interference is avoided by using randomized sleeps within a backoff window
that doubles in size each time a collision occurs.

The effective entry points to this Mixin class are the overridden
+propose_update+ and +receive_accept+ methods. Both of these methods make the
strategy aware that a value has been proposed so the resolution process must be
driven to completion. In the +propose_update+ case, the peer may immediately
begin attempting to drive the process forward. In the +receive_accept+ case, the
peer delays attempting to drive the process forward until the messaging has
ceased for a while; otherwise all peers would immediately conflict with the
original driver.



sync_strategy.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines a mixin class that periodically sends a message to a random
peer that specifies what link number it is currently on. If the receiving peer
sees that the sender has fallen behind, it will respond with a message stating
the current link number and the current value. The behind peer will then advance
it's current instance to match that contained in the reply and will update its
current value accordingly. 



master_strategy.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module defines a Mixin class that implements 'Master-Leases' and resolution
in a single round trip. While the lease is held, only that peer is allowed to
add links to the chain and the link additions will generally require only a
single round-trip to achieve consensus.

The muli-paxos chain itself is used to manage the identity of the master. The
values in the chain are two-element tuples in which one element is always
+None+. If the left element is set, it indicates a new master has been
elected. If the right element is set, it indicates a new application-level
value.

To avoid problems associated with clock-synchronization, each peer starts their
timer for the lease hold duration when they learn about the new master. All
peers will have slightly differing ideas about when the lease expires and this
may delay the elections of new masters but the current master will always attempt
to renew its lease prior to the expiry of the current one. As a result,
leadership changes will be infrequent occurrences.

This strategy is somewhat dependent upon the resolution strategy implementation
due to the need to augment the handling of the initial proposal for
single-round-trip messaging semantics. While the dedicated master lease is held,
the initial 'Prepare' message and the corresponding 'Promise' message are
locally generated and injected into the +PaxosInstance+ object. This avoids the
need to actually send them over the network. The master strategy makes a small
change to the resolution strategy's handling of the initial proposal by causing
it to simply drop the initial 'Prepare' message. All subsequent messages are
handled in the normal manner.

The overriding goals of this implementation are:

* Ensure that a new master is elected if the current lease expires
* Ensure that only the master can add links containing application-level values
* Ensure that no two peers may simultaneously believe themselves to be the master



config.py
~~~~~~~~~

Defines the members of the multi-paxos group, nodes 'A', 'B', and 'C'; and
specifies which UDP port they will run on. Additionally, each node is configured
to use a separate file for storing state. This file is used to during recovery
and ensures that it is safe to kill the server processes at any time.


client.py
~~~~~~~~~

This module implements about the simplest possible client application for
submitting requests for new values. The first argument to the program is the UID
of the peer to send the request to and the second argument is the new value to
use. The client does not wait for a response or check for errors; it simply
creates the UDP request packet, sends it to the specified peer, and exits.


server.py
~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, this module implements the server component. The server
takes a single argument which identifies the UID the server should use while
running. The server may be stopped at any point via Ctrl+C and it will pick up
where it left off the next time it's run. The server takes an optional
+--master+ argument that enables the use of the master-leases mixin class. All
peers should either use or not use the +--master+ flag simultaneously but there
is no other restriction on the use of this flag. Use of the master flag can be
turned on and off for the same chain so long as all peers are taken down prior
to making the switch.

All sent and received message traffic as well as the result of each resolution
is printed to the console. 


Uncommon Design & Feature Reference
-----------------------------------

[[mixin_classes]]
Mixin Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For individuals coming from more traditional languages like C++/Java this may be
something of a foreign concept. Mixin classes are not all that common even in
the Python community but Scala developers familiar with trait stacking should
feel right at home. The basic concept behind Mixins is to create classes that
augment the behavior of a base class by overriding specific methods and having
those overriding methods explicitly call up the inheritance chain. Classes that
follow this pattern may then be "Mixed" together in various ways to combine
those augmentations. This is subtly different from traditional multiple
inheritance so working through an example may aid in understanding how it works:

[source,python]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class NumberQueue(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = list()

    def put(self, value):
        self.q.append( value )

    def printSelf(self):
        print repr(self.q)

class DoublingMixin(object):

    def put(self, value):
        super(DoublingMixin,self).put( value * 2 )

class IncrementingMixin(object):

    def put(self, value):
        super(IncrementingMixin,self).put( value + 1 )

# In Python, calls to 'super' go left-to-right through peer super classes

class Doubler (DoublingMixin, NumberQueue):
    pass

class DoublerIncrementer (DoublingMixin, IncrementingMixin, NumberQueue):
    pass

class IncrementerDoubler (IncrementingMixin, DoublingMixin, NumberQueue):
    pass

def show(kind, q):
    q.put(2)
    q.put(3)
    q.put(4)
    print kind,
    q.printSelf()

show('Original:          ', NumberQueue())
show('Doubler:           ', Doubler())
show('DoublerIncrementer:', DoublerIncrementer())
show('IncrementerDoubler:', IncrementerDoubler())

# Outputs:
#    Original:           [2, 3, 4]
#    Doubler:            [4, 6, 8]
#    DoublerIncrementer: [5, 7, 9]
#    IncrementerDoubler: [6, 8, 10]

Python & Twisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is often referred to as "executable pseudo code" due to its rather
straight-forward nature and the ease with which even those not familiar with the
language can read the source code. This example intentionally shies away from the
more advanced Python & Twisted features in order to enhance readability but it
does use a few features that are not particularly intuitive. The following list
provides some additional context on them.

Python's super() command::
  Python's +super()+ command is typically invoked as
  +super(+'<class_name>'+,self).+'<method_name>' and it searches up the
  inheritance hierarchy for the requested method. The wrinkle, as compared to
  C++ and Java, is that it searches left-to-right through peer inherited classes
  rather than going straight up at each tier in the hierarchy. The 'Mixin'
  example demonstrates how software designs may take advantage of this.

Twisted's task.LoopingCall::
  The +task.LoopingCall()+ constructor accepts a function object as an argument
  and returns an object that is capable of repeatedly calling the function
  object at set intervals. The interval is begun with the 'start(<duration>,
  [now=True|False])' method. When the optional, 'now' argument is supplied, the
  function will be immediately invoked without first waiting for 'duration' to
  elapse. This implementation makes use of both the delayed initial
  invocation as well as the immediate invocation.
  +
  Of particular note is that all scheduling calls in Twisted, such as
  +start(<duration>)+, use floating-point times with seconds as the
  dimension. Fractional values are permitted so to call a function at 60Hz one
  could use +start(1.0/60.0)+.

Python's lambda command::
  Python's +lambda+ command creates an unnamed function that returns whatever
  the right-hand side evaluates to. In this example, lambda is used
  to create callback functions that, when called, will invoke another function
  with a certain set of arguments. For example, the following call will print
  "Hello World" every 5 seconds:
  +
[source,python]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from __future__ import print_function
from twisted.internet import task

task.LoopingCall( lambda : print("Hello World") ).start(5.0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Twisted's reactor.callLater::
  This schedules a function object to be called at some point in the future.
  the method signature is
  +reactor.callLater(+'<duration_in_seconds>'+,+'<function>'+)+
  and it returns an object that may be used to cancel the delayed invocation.
  As with LoopingCall, the duration is a floating-point value and may be used
  to specify delays of less than a second.
